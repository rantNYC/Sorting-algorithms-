# Sorting-algorithms-
Program to test the different sorting algorithms 


The steps to run the program PartA are:

1.- Compile the main file PartOne using the java compiler as follows: javac PartOne.java . This should create the class files for the main program and the other sorting algorithms.

2.-Execute PartOne using the java program. Pass the name of any text file as argument as follows: java PartOne Num8.txt Num16.txt Num32.txt…
3.- The text files must consist of numbers separated by enter. The program does not accept numbers in a single string or if the numbers have another character attached to them, for example space.

 


The steps to run the program PartB are: 
1.- Compile the main file PartTwo using the java compiler as follows: javac PartTwo.java . This should create the class files for the main program and the other sorting algorithms.

2.-Execute PartTwo using the java program. Pass the name of any text file as argument as follows: java PartOne Num8.txt Num16.txt Num32.txt…
3.- The text files must consist of numbers separated by enter. The program does not accept numbers in a single string or if the numbers have another character attached to them, for example space.
